## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Bun installed on your system

### Getting Started

2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/arshad-yaseen/typeroll.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd typeroll`
4. Install dependencies: `bun install`
5. Start development: `bun run dev`

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
2. Make your changes
3. Format your code: `bun run format`
4. Run linting: `bun run lint`
5. Run tests: `bun run test`

7. Commit your changes using the conventions below
8. Push your branch to your fork
9. Open a pull request

## Testing Your Changes

To test your bug fixes or new features, you have two options:

1. **Unit/Integration Tests**: Add tests in `tests/specs` for your specific changes and run `bun run test`
2. **Manual Testing**: Add test files in `tests/fixtures` with an entry point at `index.ts`, then check `play.ts` and run `bun run play` which will run typeroll bundling with `tests/fixtures/index.ts` as the entry point

## Commit Message Conventions

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear and structured commit messages:

- `feat:` New features
